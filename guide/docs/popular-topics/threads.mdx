# Threads

Threads are [`Messagable`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#messageable) objects, and can be thought of as
sub-channels inside existing channels. They allow organization of multiple topics in a channel by temporarily giving
them a separate space.

## Thread-related methods

#### Creating and deleting threads

A thread can be created by using the
[`create_thread()`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.TextChannel.create_thread) method on a
[`Message`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.Message) or
[`TextChannel`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.TextChannel) object.

```python title="threads.py"
# Using the 'Message' object.
message = bot.fetch_message(1234567890)
await message.create_thread(
    name="This message will act as the thread's starting message.",
    auto_archive_duration=60,
)

# Using the 'TextChannel' object.
channel = bot.get_channel(...)
await channel.create_thread(
    name="This thread requires a starting message to be specified.",
    auto_archive_duration=60,
    message=message,
)
```

#### Joining and leaving threads

#### Archiving, unarchiving and locking threads

#### Public and private threads

#### Adding and removing members
