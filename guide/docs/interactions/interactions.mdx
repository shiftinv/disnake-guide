# What are interactions?

An **Interaction** is the message that your bot receives when a user initiates an application command or a message
component.

## Interactions and Bot Users

We're all used to the way that Discord bots have worked for a long time. You make an application in
[Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), make a new bot user, and copy the token. Interactions
bring something entirely new - the ability to interact with an application _without needing a bot user in the guild_.
Responding to the interaction doesn't require a bot token.

`disnake` is primarily focused on using the gateway events, so you still need a bot user. Check out
[`hikari-py`](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) with their REST-API part for this purpose.

Welcome to the new world.

## Responding to interactions

You have only 3 seconds to respond to the interaction. If do not have time to do it, Discord will shown "This
interaction failed" error.

In fact, there are 3 types of interactions:

-   [`ApplicationCommandInteraction`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#applicationcommandinteraction) (for
    [application commands](./application-commands))
-   [`MessageInteraction`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#messageinteraction) (for
    [message components](./message-components))
-   [`Interaction`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#interaction) (a base class, usually not used)

But responding is the same for both interactions types.

### `interaction.response`

[`response`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.Interaction.response) attribute returns a
[`InteractionResponse`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.InteractionResponse) instance that has 4
usable methods. A response can **only be done once**. If you want to send secondary messages, consider using
[`followup`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest//api.html#disnake.Interaction.followup) webhook instead.

1. [`send_message`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.InteractionResponse.send_message) - Sends
   response message
2. [`edit_message`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_message) - Edits
   original message, you're unable to use this in application command because there are no message while you responding
3. [`defer`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.InteractionResponse.defer) - Defers the interaction
4. [`is_done`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.InteractionResponse.is_done) - Indicates whether an
   interaction response has been done before

:::note

[`defer`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.InteractionResponse.defer) works differently depending on
the type of interaction. It creates _"Bot is thinking..."_ message for application commands and doesn't throw _"This
interaction failed"_ if you're not going to respond to message components.

:::

:::note

If you're going to run long processes (more than 3 seconds) while responding, you must first defer the interaction. Then
when your response is ready you can edit the message using
[`edit_original_message`](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/api.html#disnake.Interaction.edit_original_message) method.

:::

```python title="example.py"
@bot.slash_command()
async def ping(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.send_message("Pong!")


@bot.slash_command()
async def defer(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.defer()
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    await inter.edit_original_message("The wait is over, my comrades!")
```

### `interaction.followup`

Often used when you need to send secondary messages after responding.
