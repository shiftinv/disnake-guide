# Slash Commands

A **slash command** is one of the types of client-integrated interactions a bot can create. Unlike prefix commands, these do not require the message content intent.

This section will go in-depth on the creation, types and handling of slash commands with `disnake`.

:::note

A bot needs to be authorized with the `applications.commands` scope in order to create slash commands in a guild. We recommend adding this scope to your bot invite links.

:::

## Defining slash commands

To create a slash command, use the <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.Bot.slash_command">@Bot.slash_command</DocsLink> decorator.

```python
@bot.slash_command(
    name="ping",
    description="Returns websocket latency.",
)
async def ping(inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    ...
```

<br />
<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<DiscordCommand profile="user" command="/ping"></DiscordCommand>
		Pong!
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
<br />

If using a cog, the <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.slash_command">@commands.slash_command</DocsLink> decorator should be used instead.

```python
class Meta(commands.Cog):
    """Meta commands."""

    @commands.slash_command(
        name="ping",
        description="Returns websocket latency.",
    )
    async def ping(self, inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction):
        ...
```

### Parameters

While some commands can exist without arguments, most commands will need to take user input to be useful. To define an option, its as simple as defining an argument to the callback.

Hereâ€™s an example of a command with one integer option (without a description):

```python
@bot.slash_command(description="Multiplies the number by 7")
async def multiply(inter, number: int):
    await inter.response.send_message(number * 7)
```

To make a parameter optional, provide a default value for the option.

```python
@bot.slash_command(description="Multiplies the number by a multiplier")
async def multiply(inter, number: int, multiplier: int = 7):
    await inter.response.send_message(number * multiplier)
```

### Subcommands

<!----TODO---->

## Registering commands

Unlike prefix commands, slash commands must be registered in Discord first. Otherwise they won't pop up if you press "/".
By default, the library registers or updates your slash commands automatically.
It does so on bot start or when one or several cogs are unloaded or reloaded.

:::note

The library doesn't make unnecessary API requests during this process.
If registered commands match the commands in your code, no API requests are made.
Otherwise only one bulk overwrite request is done.

:::

If you want to disable the automatic registration, set the `sync_commands` parameter of `commands.Bot` to `False`.
If you want to see how exactly the list of registered commands changes, set the `sync_commands_debug` parameter to `True`.

```python
bot = commands.Bot("!", sync_commands_debug=True)
```

It will print which commands were added, edited, deleted or untouched. It also depends on your logging level.

### Global commands

Global slash commands are visible everywhere, including your bot DMs.
If you don't specify the `test_guilds` parameter of `commands.Bot`, all your slash commands are global by default.

Global commands are visible and usable on most devices right away.

### Guild commands

If you specify the `test_guilds` parameter of `commands.Bot`, all slash commands in your code are no longer global.
The following code will register all slash commands only in 2 guilds:

```python
bot = commands.Bot("!", test_guilds=[123456789, 987654321])  # guild IDs
```

If you want to keep some of your slash commands global and make some of them local, specify the `guild_ids` parameter of `@bot.slash_command()`:

```python
bot = commands.Bot("!")


@bot.slash_command()
async def global_command(inter):
    """This command is visible everywhere"""
    ...


@bot.slash_command(guild_ids=[123456789])
async def local_command(inter):
    """This command is visible in one guild"""
    ...
```

## Responding to commands {#responding}

### Sending responses {#response}

The <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.response">response</DocsLink> attribute returns a <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse">InteractionResponse</DocsLink> instance that has 4 ways to respond to an ApplicationCommandInteraction. A response can <b>only be done once</b>. If you want to send secondary
messages, consider using a <DocsLink reference="disnake.Interaction.followup">followup</DocsLink> webhook instead.

:::warning

A response can only be used **once**. After a response is made, **no more responses can be made.** See the [followup](#followup) object for sending messages after responding.
:::

1. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.send_message">send_message</DocsLink> - Sends response message
2. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_message">edit_message</DocsLink> - Edits original message, you're
   unable to use this in application command because there are no message while you responding
3. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.defer">defer</DocsLink> - Defers the interaction
4. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.send_modal">send_modal</DocsLink> - send a <DocsLink reference="disnake.ui.Modal">
   	Modal
   </DocsLink> as a response.

Additionally, there is one method that does not make a response:

5. <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.is_done">is_done</DocsLink> - Indicates whether an interaction response
   has been done.

:::note

If you're going to run long processes (more than 3 seconds) while responding, you must first defer the interaction. Then
when your response is ready you can edit the message using <DocsLink reference="disnake.InteractionResponse.edit_original_message">edit_original_message</DocsLink> method.

:::

```python title="example.py"
@bot.slash_command()
async def ping(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.send_message("Pong!")


@bot.slash_command()
async def defer(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.defer()
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    await inter.edit_original_message(content="The wait is over, my comrades!")
```

### Followups

Followups are a way to send a message after responding. There are two important restrictions for when a followup can be used:

-   the interaction must have been responded to in the first 3 seconds (see [responding](#responses)).
-   the interaction must not be expired. Checking if an interaction has expired can be done with <DocsLink reference="disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction.is_expired">ApplicationCommandInteraction.is_expired</DocsLink>.

At their core, followups are simply <DocsLink reference="disnake.Webhook">Webhook</DocsLink> instances. There is nothing special, except that the `wait` parameter is treated as if it is alwys set to `True`.

One possible use for a followup might be to send instructions that will be visible if a modal is not submitted.

```python
@bot.slash_command()
async def confirm(inter: ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    await inter.response.send_modal(
        title="Confirm",
        custom_id="confirm-or-deny",
        components=[disnake.ui.TextInput(label="confirm?", custom_id="confirm")],
    )
    await inter.followup.send(content="Please don't deny that modal!", ephemeral=True)
```
