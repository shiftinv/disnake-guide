# Migrating from discord.py

<!-- Imports for content tabs -->

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

After the discontinuation of `discord.py` (refer
[this gist](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1)), many forks of the API wrapper branched
onward to maintain the library, in order to keep it updated with the latest features and Discord API changes - `disnake`
is one such fork.

Thus, if you've chosen `disnake` as your fork of choice in order to implement interactions/components and other
features, this page will help you understand the changes in syntax, and aim for making your migrating process as smooth
as possible.

## Differences between libraries

`disnake` is based on `discord.py 2.0`, which had major syntax changes from its previous version. Therefore, if you're
shifting to `disnake` from a version of `discord.py` lower than 2.0, you will have to make some important syntax changes
in your code. You can refer [this page](https://gist.github.com/apple502j/f75b4f24652f04de85c7084ffd73ec58) for the full
list of breaking changes in `discord.py 2.0`, though we will list some primary API reference changes here:

-   Methods and attributes that returned `TextChannel`, etc can now return `Thread`.
-   Attributes that returned `Asset` are renamed, e.g. attributes ending with `_url` (i.e. `avatar_url`) are changed to
    `avatar.url`. `User.avatar` returns `None` in case the default avatar is used.
-   `on_presence_update` replaces `on_member_update` for updates to `Member.status` and `Member.activities`.
-   Webhooks are changed significantly: `WebhookAdapter` is removed, and synchronous requests using `requests` is now
    inside `SyncWebhook`.
-   `edit` methods no longer updates cache and instead returns modified instance.
-   `Client.logout` is removed; use `Client.close` instead.
-   `Message.type` for replies are now `MessageType.reply`.
-   `Reaction.custom_emoji` property is changed to `Reaction.is_custom_emoji` method.
-   `missing_perms` attributes and arguments are renamed to `missing_permissions`.
-   Many arguments are now specified as positional-only or keyword-only; e.g. `oauth_url` now takes keyword-only
    arguments, and methods starting with `get_` or `fetch_` take positional-only arguments.

## Changing requirements

In order to avoid conflicts between the libraries, you must uninstall `discord.py`. You can do so by using the following
command in your terminal:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```
py -3 -m pip uninstall discord
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

```
python3 -m pip uninstall discord
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```
python3 -m pip uninstall discord
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To install `disnake`, you can follow the instructions on [this page](./installing-disnake).

## Rewriting your bot

As discussed above, rewriting your code from an older `discord.py` version to `disnake` will require some major syntax
changes. But if you're migrating from `discord.py 2.0`, all that's left now is changing the library references
throughout the code, since the base code for both the libraries is practically the same.

There are three ways to switch between libraries:

#### Replace `discord` with `disnake`

1. Import `disnake` into your code (and delete the lines where you import `discord`).

    ```py
    import disnake
    from disnake.ext import commands
    ```

2. With your favorite editor, replace every `discord` reference in your code with `disnake` (this is fairly simple, if
   your editor has a "Find & Replace" tool).

#### Import `disnake as discord`

Import `disnake as discord` into your code (and delete the lines where you import `discord`). This reduces the effort of
changing all references throughout your code.

```py
import disnake as discord
from disnake.ext import commands
```

#### Using the `discord` shim

Using the `discord` shim allows you to use `disnake`, without the need to import it directly or importing it as
discord - thus eliminating the need to change your code at all. To install the shim, you can use the following command
in your terminal:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```
py -3 -m pip install disnake[discord]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

```
python3 -m pip install disnake[discord]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```
python3 -m pip install disnake[discord]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning

We don't recommend using the shim, as it is updated less frequently and may break the behaviour of
interactions/components in some cases. If possible, proceed with one of the other two procedures mentioned.

:::

And that's it! Since `disnake` is a fork of `discord.py`, it inherits a lot of similarities - though we recommend you to
always run your code to fix any possible issues.
