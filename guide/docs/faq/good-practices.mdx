# Good practices

<!-- Imports for content tabs -->

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Running code when a cog is loaded

Most people are used to running everything in `__init__` but that doesn't allow running async code. In this case you can
overwrite the special `cog_load` method.

```python {5,6}
class MyCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot: commands.Bot):
        self.bot = bot

    async def cog_load(self):
        self.data = await bot.fetch_database_data()

    @commands.slash_command()
    async def command(self, interaction: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction, user: disnake.User):
        await interaction.response.send_message(self.data[user.id])
```

## Reloading your bot

A one of the lesser known disnake features is the `reload` kwarg for your bot. It reloads extensions every time they are
edited; allowing you to test your code in real-time. This is especially useful if startup times for your bot are very
slow, since only one extension will be reloaded at a time.

```python {3}
from disnake.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(..., reload=True)
```

:::caution

This should be used purely for debugging. Please do not use this in production.

## Converting arguments in commands

discord.py used to have `Converter` classes to convert arguments if they are provided. These were however very hard to
use with type-checkers because the type of the parameter is never actually the converter itself.

Disnake aims to eliminate this issue by only allowing conversion of builtin types like `disnake.Member`,
`disnake.Emoji`, etc. If you ever want to have your own converter you have to use the `converter` argument in `Param`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="disnake" label="disnake">

```python {10}
async def convert_data(inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction, arg: str):
    parts = arg.split(",")
    return {"a": parts[0], "b": int(parts[1]), "c": parts[2].lower()}


@commands.slash_command()
async def command(
    self,
    inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction,
    data: Dict[str, Any] = commands.Param(converter=convert_data),
):
    ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="discord.py" label="discord.py">

```python linenums="1"
class DataConverter(commands.Converter):
    async def convert(self, ctx: commands.Context, arg: str):
        parts = arg.split(",")
        return {"a": parts[0], "b": int(parts[1]), "c": parts[2].lower()}


@commands.command()
async def command(self, ctx: commands.Context, data: DataConverter):
    ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you absolutely want to be able to use classes you may pass in a class method. Alternatively, set a method of the
class to be the converter using `converter_method`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="classmethod" label="classmethod converter">

```python {9-12,19}
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Data:
    a: str
    b: int

    @classmethod
    async def from_option(cls, inter: disnake.CommandInteraction, arg: str):
        a, b = arg.split(",")
        return cls(a, int(b))


@commands.slash_command()
async def command(
    self,
    inter: disnake.CommandInteraction,
    data: Data = commands.Param(converter=Data.from_option),
):
    ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="converter" label="converter method">

```python {9-12,19}
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Data:
    a: str
    b: int

    @commands.converter_method
    async def from_option(cls, inter: disnake.CommandInteraction, arg: str):
        a, b = arg.split(",")
        return cls(a, int(b))


@commands.slash_command()
async def command(
    self,
    inter: disnake.CommandInteraction,
    data: Data,
):
    ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Context command targets

Instead of using `inter.target` you should be using a parameter of your command.

```python linenums="1"
@commands.user_command()
async def command(self, inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction, user: disnake.User):
    await inter.response.send_message(f"Used on {user.mention}")
```

## Slash command descriptions

You may use docstrings for command and option descriptions. Everything before `Parameters` is the command description.
Everything after `Parameters` are the option descriptions.

```python linenums="1"
@commands.slash_command()
async def command(
    self,
    inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction,
    category: str,
    item: str,
    details: bool,
):
    """Show item info

    Parameters
    ----------
    category: The category to search
    item: The item to display
    details: Whether to get the details of this time
    """
```

## Guild-only commands

While disnake does provide a `@commands.guild_only()` decorator, it still makes you handle `guild` being optional in
case you're using linters. To solve this you should be using `GuildCommandInteraction`.

```python linenums="1"
# before
@commands.slash_command()
@commands.guild_only()
async def command(inter: disnake.ApplicationCommandInteraction):
    assert inter.guild is not None
    await inter.send(inter.guild.name)


# after
@commands.slash_command()
async def command(inter: disnake.GuildCommandInteraction):
    await inter.send(inter.guild.name)
```
